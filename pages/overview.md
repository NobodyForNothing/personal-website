This website and my [GitHub](https://github.com/derdilla) host all the
stuff I want to recklessly publish and a tiny bit more that is actually useful.
I have a [**blog**](./blog) and if you dig deep enough into my unlisted pages you may
find a little app or game (or you look at [how this website is build](https://github.com/derdilla/personal-website),
but where is the fun in that).

If you just wanted to reach out to me and read through all of that: have a look 
at the footer :).
